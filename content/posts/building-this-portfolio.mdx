# Building This Portfolio in Public

When I decided to rebuild my portfolio, I had a choice: spend months perfecting it in private, or ship something functional and iterate in public. I chose the latter.

## The Stack Decision

I went with **Next.js 16** and **React 19**. Not because they're the latest and greatest, but because:

1. **App Router** gives me the file-based routing I wanted
2. **Server Components** reduce client-side JavaScript
3. **Image optimization** is built-in
4. **Vercel deployment** is seamless

For styling, I deliberately avoided component libraries. Instead, I built a custom design system with CSS custom properties. It's more work upfront, but I understand every line.

## What I Learned

### CSS Custom Properties Are Powerful

My entire color palette, spacing scale, and typography are defined in `:root`:

```css
:root {
  --color-accent: #C46A2B;
  --space-md: 1rem;
  --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
}
```

Changing the accent color? One line. Adjusting spacing? One variable.

### TypeScript Catches Real Bugs

Converting from JavaScript to TypeScript found several issues:
- Props that could be undefined
- Event handlers with wrong types
- Missing return types on functions

The investment pays off.

### Ship, Then Improve

This site isn't perfect. The Labs section was "coming soon" for weeks. Some animations could be smoother. But it's live, and I'm iterating.

## Trade-offs I Made

| Decision | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|
| Custom CSS over Tailwind | More control, more maintenance |
| No CMS | Faster development, manual content updates |
| Minimal dependencies | Smaller bundle, more custom code |

## What's Next

- Individual project case studies
- More Labs posts
- Contact form integration
- Performance optimization
